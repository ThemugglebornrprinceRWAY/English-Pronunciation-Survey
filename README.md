0. Please do not attempt this on a mobile phone or handheld device. A laptop, desktop or other more capable system is highly recommended. 
1. For each individual word, press each variant (A, B, up to F variants) and have a listen to the file.
2. On the 'Your choice' dropdown, with a '—Select—' part, select your variant (A, B, again, up to F variants, just the one you prefer). If you prefer something that is not in the 
    options, just click the 'Other / none of these' option.
3. Hit the green 'Save' button to the right of the your choice dropdown menu – this is important, as if you skip this step, your preference will not be saved.
4. Continue doing this for every word in the survey. Progress is saved locally as long as you save each selection (step three), so don't worry! One note – if you save 
    the selections for 20 questions and then cut the tab, those selections WILL be saved, but they won't be shown again (the menu will look as though nothing has been saved) 
    except for the 'Answered: | Unanswered: ' counter on the top. Hence, I strongly recommend that you take this test bit-by-bit if you are not going to do it all at once, that is, 
    the first twenty questions today, the next twenty tomorrow, until you finish the survey, as if you take random words, you will NEVER be able to remember which ones you 
    selected! Or you can take it all at once and avert any potential problems. It is entirely up to you.
5. Once you have saved all your selections (recheck with the 'Answered: | Unanswered: ' counter on top just to be sure, it should read 'Answered: 106/106 | Unanswered: 0'), click export selections. 
    It should download a pronunciation_selections.json file. Kindly rename it to your name (e.g. Aditya.json) and send it to me via email. Note: do not touch the 'Enable Edit Mode' or 
    'Export DATA JSON' buttons – they were made by me in order to simplify the creation process of this HTML file. Just ignore their presence. They shouldn't do anything terrible, but 
     it's best to leave them alone.
